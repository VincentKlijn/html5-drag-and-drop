# html5-drag-and-drop
This repository includes a demonstration of html5 drag and drop functionality.

It does so with a simple game: rock-paper-scissors.

### The HTML
The HTML is heavily commented to make identifying the elements easy and to understand their function. This is a very basic html file.

### The CSS
The CSS is heavily commented to explain the individual rules.

### The JavaScript
The JavaScript library is an external file, called from the html file. It contains all functions necessary for working with drag and drop.

All JavaScript is heavily commented, almost on a line-by-line basis, explaining what is going on.
